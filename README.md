Here are presented two scripts, one written in Bash and the other in Python, both designed to accomplish the same objective: parsing a log file to extract specific lines of interest. These extracted lines are subsequently analyzed to determine the start time, end time, and duration of events within the log. Based on these calculations, the scripts generate and display relevant messages.
